Write-Host "Monitoring Hypervisor Performance:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "- Monitor CPU, Memory, and Disk I/O on the hypervisor hosts."
Write-Host "- Pay close attention to storage latency (datastore latency)."
Write-Host "- Objective: SentinelOne's initial sync and scan should not cause a significant increase in boot times or resource contention."

# Step 4: Validate agent registration in the console
Write-Host "Validating Agent Registration:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "- Verify that all 50 new desktops appear in the SentinelOne console as unique endpoints."
Write-Host "- Check that they are assigned the correct policy."

# Step 5: Test user login performance
Write-Host "Testing User Login Performance:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "- Measure the time it takes for a user to log in and get a responsive desktop."
Write-Host "- Compare this with a baseline without the SentinelOne agent."
Write-Host "- Objective: Login time increase should be minimal (< 10-15%)."
